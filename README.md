# Senior-Design-Testing-Folder
### Raspberry Pi SSH Login
- admin@134.68.225.201
- password = adminpassword
- I figured out how to ssh into it from vscode if anyone wants to see lmk

### Raspberry Pi Directory Structure 
- Everything will be based in the admin's home directory (just input 'cd' to get here once logged in)

### Figure out list:
- Logging on each thread for error (Grant)
- Find out what address is needed to communicate with web server (changing configuration files) 

# Todo List (In Rough Order):
- Add image to DockerHub (Grant)
- Add script to be able to build the container and specify the version (Alyssa)
- Make a Docker account (Everyone)
- Make Raspberry Pi Temp/Memory(RAM & Disk)monitoring script (plot w/ matlibplot)(Andrew) https://modberry.techbase.eu/raspberry-pi/how-to-check-raspberry-pi-memory-usage-in-4-easy-steps/
Find a way for us to remotely monitor the historical values.
- Once Docker Image is available, make sure that it can connect to the database consistently, and test adding sensors in the configuration file (Alyssa)
- Start long-term monitoring of running system (Everyone)
- Make sure Home Assistant Supervised restarts when the pi is turned off
